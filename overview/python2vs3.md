# Python 2 vs. Python 3

## Unicode Support
- Python 2 had limited support for Unicode.
- Python 3 fully supports Unicode, making it easier to work with text in different languages.

## Print Statement vs. Function
- Python 2 had a `print` statement.
- Python 3 has a `print()` function, providing more flexibility and consistency.

## Division
- Python 2 would return an integer when dividing two integers, truncating the decimal part.
- Python 3 returns a float, providing more accurate division.

## Range vs. xrange
- Python 2 had both `range` and `xrange` functions.
- Python 3 removed `xrange` and made `range` behave like `xrange`, simplifying code.

## Input Function
- Python 2's `input` could evaluate the input as a Python expression.
- Python 3 introduced `input` for this purpose, while the old behavior was moved to `raw_input`.

## Error Handling
- Python 3 introduced improvements in error handling, including the `except` syntax and better traceback messages.

## Bytes and Strings
- Python 3 unified bytes and Unicode strings, simplifying the handling of text and binary data.

## Metaclasses
- Python 3 introduced changes to how metaclasses are defined and used, improving code consistency and readability.

## Syntax Changes
- Python 3 made various syntax changes and improvements, such as keyword-only arguments, `async` and `await` keywords, and f-strings.

## Library Support
- Many libraries and frameworks have transitioned to Python 3, leading to better compatibility and support.
